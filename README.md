						<p class="no-top-margin">&ldquo;I've been here a little while, & from what I've experienced, it's a night & day work culture difference between here and places I've worked in the past. It's a cozy little retreat with a family atmosphere. The management staff is so caring and respectful!! The owners are actually INVOLVED in the business!! They don't consider themselves above the staff, they come to work & help out, from the front desk to cleaning the toilets. And I personally appreciate the fact that you can contact them, and they get back to you almost immediately!! They are constantly looking for ways to pay the therapists more and more!! They go out of their way to make sure the therapists want for nothing, and...&rdquo;</p>

						<p class="no-top-margin">&ldquo;The environment, employees/coworkers, and customers all make this job a 10/10 experience. I really enjoy coming in and working with my coworkers. They really bring the vibe into this place. I could be having a not so good day and I have them to comfort and reassure me, one might even bring a crystal to raise my vibrations. All the employees feel likeâ€¦home. It really does feel like a family here and I look forward to the journey at Massage Heights.&rdquo;</p>

						<p class="no-top-margin">&ldquo;I have learned a lot as this is the busiest retreat in the atlanta area for this company. It is great for a therapist straight out of school but leaves limited options for experienced/high talented therapists. Also if you are looking for benefits (as most employees are) this particular retreat does not offer them which lowered my overall rating for them being they are in the health and wellness industry. They provide the tools for you to build your skill set, but hours are not flexible and you will work many evenings and weekends. I am grateful for the experience I have gained with them and recommend them for individuals new in the field who need to learn to master their craft.&rdquo;</p>

We make a difference at Massage Heights. We change Lives. From the front desk staff to all of the therapists there is a sense of family and team work. I have enjoyed working at the Buckhead location for the past three years and look forward to many more.&rdquo;</p>
