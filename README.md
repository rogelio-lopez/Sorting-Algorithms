# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains a web application designed to visualize the process of sorting algorithms, specifically Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. Built with TypeScript and compiled using Vite, it allows users to generate random numbers to observe how these sorting algorithms rearrange the numbers to bring them into sorted order. The application also features adjustable speed controls for the sorting animation, enhancing the learning experience.

## Features

- Visualize the process of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms.
- Generate random numbers and visualize their sorting.
- Adjustable speed controls for the sorting animation.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: The primary language used for development.
- **Vite**: A build tool and development server that leverages native ES modules for fast development.
